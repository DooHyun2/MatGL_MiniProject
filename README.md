Using MatGL cpu version

A small exploratory project to understand how MatGL handles atomic structures
and what structure-based representation means in materials modeling.

What I tried
* Loading and visualizing a LiFePo₄ structure
* Running minimal MatGL examples on CPU
* Observing how a GNN model reads structural information at a very conceptual level

This repository is a small learning note and will be expanded as i continue
studying polymer-related representations.
 # Next Steps
* Try structural representations for polymer systems
